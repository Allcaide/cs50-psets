                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm Luís, a 26-year-old Chemical and Biochemical Engineer. I've always been passionate about engineering. My journey started in Environmental Engineering, but after some time, I realized it wasn’t the right fit. I then shifted to Chemical Engineering but faced challenges getting accepted into the program. During that time, I spent a year studying Computer Science, which sparked a deep interest in programming and technology.

When I finally joined Chemical Engineering, it felt amazing because it was what I had always wanted. However, my love and curiosity for Computer Science never faded. That’s why I’ve decided to expand my knowledge in this area, focusing on blockchain programming and smart contracts. My plan is to develop solid expertise in these technologies by the end of the year 2025, guided by the roadmap on Programming Journey and future plans.
